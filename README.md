# E-commerce Recommendation System
Building a system to suggest items based on user behavior from an e-commerce dataset.

## Goal
Suggest items to users using past interactions (views, add-to-carts, transactions), item properties, and removing abnormal users for accuracy.

## Analytical Questions
1. Which items are most viewed, added to cart, or bought?
2. Do users with similar viewing patterns also add similar items to carts?
3. How do item properties (e.g., category, price) relate to add-to-cart events?
4. Can I spot abnormal users (e.g., too many views, no buys) to remove them?
5. How accurate are my suggestions compared to actual transactions?
6. Are suggested items diverse across categories?
7. How fast can I generate suggestions with this data size?
